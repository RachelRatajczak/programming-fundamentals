**Geometric Objects (Java)**

This project implements basic geometric objects in Java to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
Overview

The program defines geometric shapes with shared and shape-specific properties and methods. It demonstrates how inheritance and polymorphism can be used to model related objects in a clean and extensible way.
Features

	•	Abstract base class for geometric shapes
	•	Inheritance for specific shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle)
	•	Encapsulation of shape properties
	•	Methods to compute area and perimeter
	•	Use of method overriding and polymorphism
