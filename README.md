**programming-fundamentals**

This repository contains foundational computer science projects developed to strengthen programming, object-oriented design, and algorithmic thinking skills.

These projects are not domain-specific applications, but they support the computational background used in data analysis, machine learning, and bioinformatics workflows.
Contents

**Java OOP Programming**

	•	Geometric Objects
	◦	Implements basic object-oriented principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and method overriding.
	◦	Calculates geometric properties such as area and perimeter for different shapes.

**Data Structures & Algorithms**

	•	Ant Farm Simulation
	◦	Java-based simulation demonstrating algorithmic thinking and object-oriented design.
	◦	Focuses on state management, interaction rules, and structured program flow.

**Notes**

These projects represent early and foundational work and are included for completeness of technical background.
